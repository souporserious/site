title: Bundling TypeScript With Esbuild for NPM
date: 2021-06-03
summary: Compared to other build tools, Esbuild is a radically more performant bundler. This post will look at setting up a build script to compile TypeScript projects for NPM.

Follow along at the repo below to see a working example:

## Getting Started

First, we'll install the library and set up our build script:

<!-- add preference option for bundler -->

```bash
yarn add esbuild typescript
```

```bash
npm install esbuild typescript
```

```json filename=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node build"
  }
}
```

Esbuild will automatically detect we are using TypeScript and attempt to load a `tsconfig.json` file if available. Note that your `tsconfig.json` compiler options like `target` will take precedence over the `buildSync` options.

```js filename=build.js
const { buildSync } = require('esbuild')

buildSync({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  outdir: 'dist',
  bundle: true,
})
```

An important option we need to set is the `external` property. This makes sure not to bundle all of our dependencies since we are publishing this library to NPM. Convinently enough, we can use our `package.json` file as a source of truth:

```js {2,8} filename=build.js
const { buildSync } = require('esbuild')
const { dependencies, peerDependencies } = require('./package.json')

buildSync({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  outdir: 'dist',
  bundle: true,
  external: Object.keys(dependencies).concat(Object.keys(peerDependencies)),
})
```

Now, if we run our script, we should see our built files in a `dist` directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

```bash
npm run build
```

## Additional Formats

When bundling libraries for NPM, it's good practice to build multiple files for different browser and bundler formats. We can do this easily by pulling out shared options and passing them into any number of different builds we want to provide. By default, `format` is set to [iife](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-iife), which bundles for a browser environment. Let's add a format for ESM users:

```js
const { build } = require('esbuild')
const { dependencies, peerDependencies } = require('./package.json')

const shared = {
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  bundle: true,
  external: Object.keys(dependencies).concat(Object.keys(peerDependencies)),
}

build({
  ...shared,
  outfile: 'dist/index.js',
})

build({
  ...shared,
  outfile: 'dist/index.esm.js',
  format: 'esm',
})
```

## Type Definitions

Since Esbuild can only bundle our code, we still need to generate definition files. This will allow library consumers to utilize the types we've written.

While it's relatively simple to emit multiple declaration files [using TypeScript directly](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-wiki/blob/master/Using-the-Compiler-API.md#getting-the-dts-from-a-javascript-file), the [npm-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-dts) library helps us bundle our types into one succinct file:

```js
const { Generator } = require('npm-dts')

new Generator({
  entry: 'src/index.ts',
  output: 'dist/index.d.ts',
}).generate()
```

## Publishing to NPM

Make sure the fields in your `package.json` file are filled out correctly and point to the proper files we've created:

```json filename=package.json
{
  "module": "dist/index.esm.js",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "typings": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

Now we're ready to publish our library! ðŸŽ‰

```bash
yarn publish
```

```bash
npm publish
```

## Conclusion

We looked at how Esbuild provides a fast build system that we can use to compile and bundle TypeScript when developing libraries for NPM. In the future, I imagine we'll see a type checker written in a performant language like Go or Rust that will drastically speed up our workflows.
