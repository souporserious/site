title: Generate TypeScript Docs Using TS Morph
date: 2021-06-15
summary: TypeScript provides rich feedback about how our code should work. In this post, we'll look at using TS Morph to auto-generate docs for functional React components.

A handful of tools for reading types exist in the wild like [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) and [react-docgen-typescript](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript). These tools work well for the most part but are limited in the features they offer. Building a library to parse all of the possible combinations TypeScript offers is no easy task. Today, we're going to look at using a tool called [TS Morph](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph) to see how far we can get reading types with a strong set of utilities.

Follow along at the repo [here](https://github.com/souporserious/generate-typescript-docs-using-ts-morph) to see a working example. The author of TS Morph has also provided a fantastic [AST viewer](https://ts-ast-viewer.com/#code/C4TwDgpgBAogHgQwLZgDYQAoCcD2YDOUAvFAN4BQUUA9AFRQAqAFtMAJbDpQ4BmUwLKBEQp0AOii1qlfh3QAuKPmBY2AOwDm5GXUaCAxjlQ4s3PgNbDgEqTMPGsAfkXLVm7VV3NoTE2wBeOGrACKhQoWwaakgQwWb8gsBWNtJUEVHOUADk6DzAWVAAPtn6sUlYBcVZqhpM+eQAvtrCYCbAUDwArmr67EGwImgQABSkspwQADRQ9ibT6WpQDYrwyEPYePgAlGQyWBDAnViLap2oqI3kQA) that helps show what we can query.

## Getting Started

We'll start by installing the libraries we need, defining a new `project`, and reading in an example file that exports a React component:

```bash
yarn add typescript ts-morph
```

```ts
import * as path from 'path'
import { Project } from 'ts-morph'

const project = new Project({
  tsConfigFilePath: path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'tsconfig.json'),
})
const source = project.getSourceFile(path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'Example.tsx'))
```

```tsx
type ExampleProps = {
  /* The title of the example. */
  title?: string

  /* The color of the text. */
  color?: string

  /* The horizontal alignment of the text. */
  align?: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'
}

export function Example({ title, color, align }: ExampleProps) {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        color,
        textAlign: align,
      }}
    >
      {title}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Querying Functional Components

Now that our project is set up, we can query all of the functions in our file using the `getFunctions` method on `source`. In our case, we're only interested in particular functions which are exported and start with a captial letter since this is how components are defined in JSX:

```ts
const components = source.getFunctions().filter((declaration) => {
  const name = declaration.getName()
  const isComponent = name[0] === name[0].toUpperCase()
  return isComponent && declaration.hasExportKeyword()
})
```

## Reading Prop Types

Now that we have all of the functions we care about, we can start to iterate through their types to gather the information we want to display:

```ts
const docs = components.forEach((declaration) => {
  const [props] = declaration.getParameters()
  const type = props.getType()
})
```

Here we're using the `getParameters` helper to read the function's arguments. We pull off the first argument, which in React's case is the component's props. Next, we get the type and its properties that are associated with the component props. We'll use `getTypeAtLocation` and pass it the declaration to get each prop type:

```ts {4-13}
const docs = components.map((declaration) => {
  const [props] = declaration.getParameters()
  const type = props.getType()
  const typeProps = type.getProperties().map((prop) => {
    return {
      name: prop.getName(),
      type: prop.getTypeAtLocation(declaration).getText(),
    }
  })
  return {
    name: declaration.getName(),
    typeProps,
  }
})
```

While the name and prop types are helpful, it would be nice to pull in the comments we've associated with each type. Thanks to this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47429792/is-it-possible-to-get-comments-as-nodes-in-the-ast-using-the-typescript-compiler), we can use `getLeadingCommentRanges` library to read the first comment:

```ts
const docs = components.map((declaration) => {
  const [props] = declaration.getParameters()
  const type = props.getType()
  const typeProps = type.getProperties().map((prop) => {
    const [range] = ts.getLeadingCommentRanges(
      source.getFullText(),
      prop.getValueDeclaration().getFullStart()
    )
    return {
      name: prop.getName(),
      type: prop.getTypeAtLocation(declaration).getText(),
      comment: source.getFullText().slice(range.pos, range.end),
    }
  })
  return {
    name: declaration.getName(),
    typeProps,
  }
})
```

<Disclaimer>

Note, we use the `ts` library exported from TS Morph to access `getLeadingCommentRanges`. There seems to be a [first-class way to get comments](https://ts-morph.com/details/comments#comment-ranges) from a `Node`, but props return a `Symbol`, so I'm not sure how to use this API.

</Disclaimer>

That's it for today! I encourage you to further play around with this example and see if you can query the default value for each type.

## Conclusion

There is still a lot more we'd need to handle here to make this production-ready, like checking if the function is wrapped in `React.forwardRef` or determine if the type is imported from another file, among many other edge cases. I'm still learning about this library, but I am excited about the possibilities it brings! I particularly enjoy that the API feels friendly and makes static analysis a lot easier.
