title: Throw away code
date: 2020-01-28
summary: Always in search of the best abstraction. We can benefit greatly by having strong primitives that allow us to move quickly, effectively and ultimately allow us to throw away and start over.

Abstraction is at the heart of design and development. Designers abstract collections of UI and rules into components or symbols and developers use functions or modules or even components!

The ability to write and throw away code is crucial. Being able to sit down and iterate through multiple use cases allows us to validate ideas more quickly. This has been the case for most tools in the last decade that have sprouted up offering easy ways to piece together UI into prototypes to validate ideas more quickly.

The best part of having a solid abstraction though is that when we need to come back to our code weeks, months, years later we should have a pretty good grasp on what is going on. Proper constrainst will allow this and there's no silver bullet. It's constantly evolving and things like codemods allow us to evolve changes as we need.
