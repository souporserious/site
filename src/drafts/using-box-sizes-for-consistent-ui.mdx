All UI requires some sort of dimension. Most is boxes within boxes. How these boxes work together is important when considering them all working together for you as the developer and for your users preferences whether they need to zoom capablities, etc.

We can either pull these sizes from thin air of if your team has a specified design system you may reference that. I recommend using something like 8 point grid to simplify these values.

Similar to how t-shirts are sized from xxs - xxl. We can use consistant box sizes to build our UI. I personally think t-shirt sizing is the most pragmatic approach for people to understand so we'll stick with those for today.
