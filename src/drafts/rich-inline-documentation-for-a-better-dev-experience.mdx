JSDoc is a simple format for annotating code to provide useful information.

```js
/**
 * Get the width for a single line of text
 * @param {String} text - the string of text to be measured
 * @param {Object|HTMLElement} font - optional font styles or node to pull font styles from

 */
 ```

 Most of the time this is used to automatically generate documentation which is great! Recently, we've seen IDE's like VSCode that actually use this information as your typing to provide the same rich information inline!

 Let's take a look at a simple function for gathering all of the tabbable children in a 

 The best part about this is we can even link to our actual documentation site from the inline information!

 We looked at how adding simple comments with some meta information about our functions can greatly increase code usability and giving developers the proper avenues for learning about your software as well as reporting bugs.
