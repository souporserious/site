Today, we'll learn how the seemingly subtle [useId](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/111) hook coming to React 18 can significantly help screen readers and ensure proper accessibility for your applications. A combo box is one of those components you hope you never have to make and instead wish the platform offered a solution for. By the end of this article, we'll have a combo box component to help users autocomplete a list of results. Let's get started!

First, we'll reference the [wai-aria examples for combo box](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/listbox-combo.html#ex_label). To keep things simple, we'll duplicate the first example in React. We'll start by creating a custom `ComboBox` component and render an input with the attributes mentioned in the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox). A combo box requires proper context, which today will be showing a list of results that users can manually choose to autocomplete their favorite fruit.

```jsx
function ComboBox() {
  return <input aria-autocomplete="list" />
}
```

We then add our list where we'll render results using the `children` prop, which offers a better experience for user's to compose options similar to how the native `select` element works:

```jsx
function ComboBox({ children, value }) {
  return (
    <>
      <input aria-autocomplete="list" value={value} />
      <ul role="listbox">{children}</ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx
import { useId } from 'react'

function ComboBox({ children, value }) {
  const id = useId()
  return (
    <>
      <input aria-autocomplete="list" aria-controls={id} value={value} />
      <ul role="listbox" id={id}>
        {children}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

Next, we need to implement a `Result` component library users can provide for the results. The spec requires using a unique identifier for `aria-activedescendant`. We can again utilize `useId` to generate an id for each list item we can target.

```jsx
import { useId } from 'react'

function Result({ value }) {
  const id = useId()
  return (
    <li id={id} role="option">
      {value}
    </li>
  )
}
```
