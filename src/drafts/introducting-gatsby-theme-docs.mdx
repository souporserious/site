This is a constrained theme that I plan to start using to document my open source projects with. It allows you to easily document React components and provide links to that documentation. It parses Prop Types, TypeScript, and Flow as well as JSDoc to build rich documentation that always stays in sync.

Alternatives

This is my constrained solution and might not be for you. I highly suggest some of these projects as alternatives:

ReactDocs
Docusarus
StoryBooks
