Skip links are a great way to allow users to move through your content more fluidly.

Landmarks (voicer over rotor / nvdia element list) allow screen readers to move through content more easily, but keyboard users are left in the dust. By using skip links we can get the best experience for everyone.

However, this is for keyboard users.

let's look at how we can build a set of skip links that help accessible users while keeping it out of the way for users that prefer navigating with a mouse.

- add skip link component
- adds multiple spots
- gives a general component that collects all skip links
