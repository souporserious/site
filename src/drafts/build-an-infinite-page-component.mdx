In a recent project, I wanted to display an extensive list of items in an infinite row to keep things compact and easy to navigate in either direction. I've previously handled infinite paging in [react-view-pager](https://github.com/souporserious/react-view-pager) but wanted to build a new implementation in [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) since I could greatly simplify things. There are a few tricky pieces to this component, so let's get started!

Follow along with the Codesandbox demo here:

## Start with the API

First, we'll start by stubbing out the initial API for our `Page` component. Doing this helps to formulate what the implementation will look like:

```jsx
import randomGradient from 'random-gradient'
import { Page, View } from './Page'

function App() {
  return (
    <Page>
      {[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((index) => (
        <View
          key={index}
          width={400}
          height={400}
          color={randomGradient(index)}
        />
      ))}
    </Page>
  )
}
```

## Initial implementation

We'll start by implementing the parent `Page` component. We need a track that moves along the `x` axis:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Page() {
  return (
    <motion.div>
      <motion.div>{children}</motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```
