Coming from a design background one of the first styles I would add to my stylesheet was `outline: 0` because I didn't think the styling worked well with the designs I was creating. Later in my career, I learned that this is a major accessibility issue for people that use screenreaders or navigate via keyboard.

You may find that your design team fights back on adding outline styles.

If you happen to play video games, pay attention to how they use focus states when navigating a menu screens in games. Or the next time you turn on your tv and watch Netflix. There are great examples of how focus indicators are used to guide us even if we may not notice it. That's the best design after all. Just make sure it's inclusive to all of you users.

Don't forget to have `active` states as this helps mouse users determine what they have clicked.

By using newer browser features we are able to give a great experience for everybody across the board. Accessibility is a human right and should not be an afterthought. I challenge you to fight for accessible solutions wherever you can in your workplace and life in general.
