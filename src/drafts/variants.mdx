Variants are how configurations or APIs cascade, merge and inherit from each other.

Top down similar to React is the easiest model to understand.

```jsx
const cool = () => (
  <VariantProvider
    variants={{
      [Spinner]: {
        // component props to override
        size: [
          'md', // default key
          {
            sm: {
              width: 2,
              height: 2,
              borderWidth: 3,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      // Can we use Proxies like immer to build a schema?
      // modes: {
      //   dark: {}
      // }
    }}
  >
    <StackView>
      <Spinner /> {/* size sm by default */}
      <Spinner size="md" />
    </StackView>
  </VariantProvider>
)
const cool = () => (
  <ThemeProvider
    theme={{
      [Spinner]: {
        sizes: {
          xs: {},
        },
      },
      [Button]: {
        color: 'red',
      },
    }}
  >
    <StackView>
      <Spinner />
      <Spinner size="sm" />
    </StackView>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

Variants pair well with state machines

By keeping our component interfaces simple and having a first-class system to change props

Uber's modifier system and styled-system's variant system.

Variants should be considered how _props change over time_ and modifiers are one-off tweaks we may need to add when composing a UI.

## Nested variants
