date: 2020-11-18
summary: With the introduction of SwiftUI came a refined API to control UI layout. In this post, we'll look at how we can transfer these paradigms to the web.

If you'd like the history on Stack layouts and why they are useful, please check out my other post [Easier Layouts with Stacks](/easier-layouts-with-stacks/).

Today we'll be using React and Emotion, but the same principles should apply to any library that supports components or templates.

## HStack

Responsible for arranging views horizontally, we can use a simple Grid with `autoFlow` set to `column`. This will make sure as children are added, they default to creating new columns.

## VStack

Similar to HStack we can set `autoFlow` to `row`. This will make sure as children are added, they default to creating new rows.

## ZStack

This primitive is responsible for _overlaying_ children and aligning them on both axes. We use `placeItems` to align both axes of our children and set each immediate child to `gridArea: 1/1`. This will place children on top of one another, similar to position absolute, but preserving the layout.

And that's it! Now we have layout primitives similar to SwiftUI ðŸŽ‰
