title: Bundling TypeScript With Esbuild for NPM
date: 2021-06-06
summary: Compared to other build tools, Esbuild is a radically more performant bundler. This post will look at setting up a build script to compile TypeScript projects for NPM.

Follow along with the example repo [here](https://github.com/souporserious/bundling-typescript-with-esbuild-for-npm).

## Getting Started

First, we'll install the library and set up our build script:

```bash
npm install esbuild typescript --save-dev
```

```json filename=package hideNumbers
"scripts": {
  "build": "node build.js"
}
```

```js filename=build
const { build } = require('esbuild')

build({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  outdir: 'dist',
  bundle: true,
})
```

Esbuild will automatically detect that we're using TypeScript and attempt to load a `tsconfig.json` file if available. Note that any compiler options set in `tsconfig.json` will take precedence over `build` options.

An important option we need to set is the `external` property. Since we are publishing this library to NPM we'll want to exclude any of our dependencies from the final bundle. Convinently enough, we can use our `package.json` file as a source of truth:

```js {2,8}
const { build } = require('esbuild')
const { dependencies, peerDependencies } = require('./package.json')

build({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  outdir: 'dist',
  bundle: true,
  external: Object.keys(dependencies).concat(Object.keys(peerDependencies)),
})
```

Now, if we run our script, we should see our built files in a `dist` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Additional Formats

When bundling libraries for NPM, it's good practice to build multiple files for different browser and bundler formats. We can do this easily by pulling out shared options and passing them into any number of different builds we want to provide. By default, `format` is set to [iife](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-iife), which bundles for a browser environment. Let's add a format for ESM users:

```js filename=build
const { build } = require('esbuild')
const { dependencies, peerDependencies } = require('./package.json')

const shared = {
  entryPoints: ['src/index.ts'],
  bundle: true,
  external: Object.keys(dependencies).concat(Object.keys(peerDependencies)),
}

build({
  ...shared,
  outfile: 'dist/index.js',
})

build({
  ...shared,
  outfile: 'dist/index.esm.js',
  format: 'esm',
})
```

## Type Definitions

Since Esbuild can only bundle our code, we still need to generate definition files. This will allow library consumers to utilize the types we've written. While it's relatively simple to emit multiple declaration files [using TypeScript directly](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-wiki/blob/master/Using-the-Compiler-API.md#getting-the-dts-from-a-javascript-file), the [npm-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-dts) library helps us bundle our types into one succinct file:

```bash
npm install npm-dts
```

```js filename=build
const { Generator } = require('npm-dts')

new Generator({
  entry: 'src/index.ts',
  output: 'dist/index.d.ts',
}).generate()
```

## Publishing to NPM

Make sure the fields in your `package.json` file are filled out correctly and point to the proper files we've created:

```json filename=package hideNumbers
{
  "module": "dist/index.esm.js",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "typings": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

Now we're ready to publish our library! ðŸŽ‰

```bash
npm publish
```

## Conclusion

We looked at how Esbuild provides a fast build system that we can use to compile and bundle TypeScript when developing libraries for NPM. In the future, I imagine we'll see a type checker written in a performant language like Go or Rust that will drastically speed up our workflows.
